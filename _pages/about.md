I am a PhD Student in the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience.html) at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/). I am currently being advised by [Prof. Masud Rahman](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~masud/), and [Prof. Foutse Khomh](http://www.khomh.net/). My primary research interests are at the interesection of Software Engineering and Deep Learning, with a focus on secure, reliable and explainable deep learning systems. My current research focuses on understanding the behaviour of bugs in deep learning systems, and trying to improve reproducibility of deep learning bugs.

Before joining my PhD, I was a Software Engineer at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/in-en) for 2.5 years, where I worked on building products for the largest German multi-national investment bank and worked on technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Angular, Node.js, and Nest.js, and prior to that, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [Manipal University Jaipur](https://jaipur.manipal.edu/), with a CGPA of 9.56/10.
